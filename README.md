Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain input features. This README file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, installation instructions, dataset information, and usage guidelines.

Project Purpose:
The main purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of diabetes. By analyzing various factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, the model aims to provide an estimation of the probability of an individual having diabetes. Early detection can help individuals take preventive measures and seek appropriate medical guidance.

Installation:
To use this project, please follow the instructions below:

Clone the project repository from GitHub: https://github.com/VanshC12/Diabetes-Prediction.git

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Once the dependencies are installed, you are ready to use the project.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset. It contains a collection of anonymized patient records, each with several features including age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin level, glucose level, and diabetes diagnosis (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes). The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in the projectÂ repository.
